# Help / Onboarding

**Trigger:** "help", "what can you do", "how does this work", first message in a conversation, or any time the user seems lost

**What to do:**

If this is a new conversation or the user seems unfamiliar, give a friendly overview:

"I help you manage pre-sales projects from requirements to developer handoff. Here's the standard flow:

**Main Pipeline:**
1. **Set up a new project** — I'll create the folders and config for you
2. **Ingest requirements** — I read PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, emails, and images
3. **Generate overview & questions** — I analyze the requirements and draft client questions
4. **Create breakdown & estimates** — I generate user stories with effort estimates
5. **Push to Azure DevOps** — I create epics, features, stories, and tasks in ADO
6. **Generate feature code** — I scaffold working code from a story, push a feature branch with frontend code, API contract for backend, and a review guide

**Also available:**
- **Extract design system** — I read your Figma file structure and capture colors, typography, spacing, component patterns, and screen blueprints
- **Generate tests** — after developers review the feature code, I generate comprehensive tests mapped to each acceptance criterion
- **Handle change requests** — I analyze scope changes and calculate impact
- **Product document** — I maintain a living document that always reflects the current state of the app
- **Validate designs** — I compare Figma designs against ADO stories to find gaps *(optional, on request)*

Just tell me what you'd like to do, or say 'status' to see where a project stands."

If there are existing projects, mention them: "I see you have a project called 'GlossaryTest'. Want to work on that, or start a new one?"
