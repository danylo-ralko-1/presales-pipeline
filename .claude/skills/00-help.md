# Help / Onboarding

**Trigger:** "help", "what can you do", "how does this work", first message in a conversation, or any time the user seems lost

**What to do:**

If this is a new conversation or the user seems unfamiliar, give a friendly overview:

"I help you manage pre-sales projects from requirements to developer handoff. Here's what I can do:

1. **Set up a new project** — I'll create the folders and config for you
2. **Ingest requirements** — I read PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, emails, and images
3. **Generate overview & questions** — I analyze the requirements and draft client questions
4. **Create breakdown & estimates** — I generate user stories with effort estimates
5. **Push to Azure DevOps** — I create epics, features, stories, and tasks in ADO
6. **Validate designs** — I compare Figma designs against ADO stories to find gaps
7. **Enrich stories** — I update ADO stories with detailed acceptance criteria from Figma
8. **Handle change requests** — I analyze scope changes and calculate impact
9. **Generate specs** — I create FE and BE implementation specs for developers
10. **Product document** — I maintain a living document that always reflects the current state of the app

Just tell me what you'd like to do, or say 'status' to see where a project stands."

If there are existing projects, mention them: "I see you have a project called 'GlossaryTest'. Want to work on that, or start a new one?"
